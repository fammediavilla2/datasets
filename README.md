## [Anscombe's quartet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fammediavilla2/datasets/main/Anscombe_quartet_data.csv)

Anscombe's quartet comprises four data sets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics, yet have very different distributions and appear very different when graphed. Each dataset consists of eleven (x,y) points. They were constructed in 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe to demonstrate both the importance of graphing data when analyzing it, and the effect of outliers and other influential observations on statistical properties. He described the article as being intended to counter the impression among statisticians that "numerical calculations are exact, but graphs are rough."

## [Iris](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fammediavilla2/datasets/main/Iris.csv)

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set used and made famous by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".

## [Whiteside](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fammediavilla2/datasets/main/whiteside.csv)

Mr Derek Whiteside of the UK Building Research Station recorded the weekly gas consumption and average external temperature at his own house in south-east England for two heating seasons, one of 26 weeks before, and one of 30 weeks after cavity-wall insulation was installed. The object of the exercise was to assess the effect of the insulation on gas consumption.

## [Titanic](https://github.com/fammediavilla2/datasets/blob/main/titanic.csv)

This is a classic dataset used in many data mining tutorials and demos -- perfect for getting started with exploratory analysis and building binary classification models to predict survival.

[WineQT]()

This is a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset?resource=download) and it is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on it's quality. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more "normal" wines than excellent or poor ones).Your task is to predict the quality of wine using the given data.
